## Sean's Pub Aggregator

Aggregator I made to collect lots of different aspects of my digital persona in one space.

```
npm run deploy
```

# Getting Started

Add sources with `.fetch()` methods and `.env` api keys.
Collect all items in `{ title, url, comment, tags, datetime, source }` format. 
Run `npm run fetch && npm run build` to fetch and build site using handlebars template.
Use `npm run copy`  to deploy files to the correct location for apache.
Tada! Site deployed.
